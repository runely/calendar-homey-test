/**
 * Homey (SDK3) always runs in UTC. So to run this as close to Homey as possible, launch this with "env TZ=UTC node raw.js" or call the raw script "npm run raw"
 * 
 * Remember that "Customized Time Zone" is converted to local timezone which for Homey (SDK3) will be UTC and Africa/Abidjan
 * 
 * IcalCalendar will apply the timezone where the Homey is located (chosen in Homey app -> More -> Settings -> Position) to get the correct time for the event
 * 
 * However, if an event uses Customized Time Zone, node-ical will treat this as UTC, and IcalCalendar will apply the timezone from the Homey. This will probably not be correct
 * 
 * Therefore, when IcalCalendar finds Africa/Abidjan as start tz and Etc/UTC as dtstamp tz, the event will be flagged as not to have the Homey timezone applied. Meaning that the raw time shown in the ics file is what will be used
 *
